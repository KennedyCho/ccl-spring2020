# Homework: Poster Recreation

Your poster should include at least one shape (even if it is a rectangle), at least on text item, and a color besides black and white. You may use the p5 'image' function to incorporate an image into your sketch, but you should not use this to avoid drawing shapes, images, and text.

This assignment is also a test of your use of git and GitHub. It should contain at least three commits, that represent your code at different development stages.

Please keep track of how long you spent on this assignment. The length of time is not a factor in the grading, but is used to improve the course.
